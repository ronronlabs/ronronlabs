# Hi, I'm Daniel Young!

Iâ€™m a passionate citizen data scientist and advocate for **data democracy**, with over a decade translating complex analytics into clear, actionable insights for non-tech teams. My work in championing innovation and citizen development was featured in Professor Tom Davenportâ€™s new book. With expertise in statistical modeling, machine learning, and AI, I specialize in making data accessible to everyone, bridging the gap between deep tech and everyday decisions.

My core belief: technology and AI should serve people, not the other way around. I lead initiatives in **data science**, **predictive modeling**, **credit risk**, **default forecasting**, **geospatial analytics**, and **location intelligence** to drive smarter choices at scale.

## Projects
